# Lightsaber PCB
EDES301 Lightsaber Project 2 - PCB Design

The files in this repository outline the PCB (printed circuit board) designed and generated using Eagle. Included are pdf files of the schematic, top and bottom layers of the board, gerber files for all layers of the board, a bill of materials, and a mechanical block diagram. All files necessary for manufacturing can be found here.

The pdfs can be used to see the schematic and overall design of the board.
The gerber files can be used for manufacturing the board.
The bill of materials can also be used for manufacturing the board.
The mecanical block diagram can be used for understanding the measurements of the board.

This PCB was designed with the help and direction of Erik Welsh.
